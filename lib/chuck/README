1) Start a MIDI bus like MIDI Patchbay. ChucK will send notes to it.

2) Start ChucK server:
  $ chuck lib/chuck/cyclone.ck lib/chuck/server.ck

3) Then start Archaeopteryx:
  $ ruby eval_style.rb

Start with this eval_style.rb (note $clock and $measures!):

---START---
require 'lib/archaeopteryx'

$mutation = L{|measure| 0 == (measure - 1) % 2}

$clock = Clock.new(60*4) # make measures "1" long
$measures = 1 # ChucK asks for one measure at a time

@loop = ChucKArkx.new(:clock => $clock,
                      :logging => false,
                      :generator => Rhythm.new(:drumfile => "db_drum_definition.rb",
                                                :mutation => $mutation))
@loop.go
---END---
